Hi, I’m Annika. I recently finished a B.Sc in Geophysics, and am continuing to learn python and jupyter notebooks remotely. I’m currently learning how to use github and trying to use object oriented programming, and I'm working through Automate the Boring Stuff to cover some bases. I’m willing to collaborating on anything! How to reach me: annika.e.naylor@gmail.com
